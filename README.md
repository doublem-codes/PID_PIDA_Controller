# PID and PIDA Controllers

## Run the program
To run the program launch the figure in the command window.

## Documentation

In this program we implement Genetic Algorithm (GA) in determing PID and PIDA controllers parameters to compensate different benchmark systems.

## Explanation of the program
> A simple explanation of the user interface of the programme and which parameters it calculates.

- After launching the program, select the Benchsmark system you want to compensate and select the objective function that is used to evaluate fitness of each chromosome.

- The Program will display the step response of feedback system with PID and PIDA controller and the system you have selected.

- The program will also export an Excel file in the same folder of the program with step informations such as Rise time, settling time, and other step-response characteristics.
